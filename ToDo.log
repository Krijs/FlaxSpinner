1. Handle misclicks that accidentally make character climb the ladder next to the bank (plane 3)
2. Handle (potential) misclicks that accidentally make character descend to ground floor (plane 0) [failsafe, never happened]
3. Handle misclicks that push character through the door next to the spin room if it's open. Some anti-botter may close it on us
4. Rewrite logic in UserStairs.java to work properly. Clicks unnecessairly
5. Fix nodes to not activate when user is on login/lobby screen so the bot can reload properly.
